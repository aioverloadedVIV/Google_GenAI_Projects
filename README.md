# Google-GenAI-Project  

This project is part of my **AI Engineering - working with API Models** where I experiment with Google’s **Gemini API models**.  
It demonstrates how to connect with Gemini via Python SDK, configure environment keys, and generate responses from text and multimodal prompts.

## Current Progress
- Setup Gemini API in Python
- Authenticated using `.env` file
- Listed available model names
- Next: Generate text and multimodal responses

## Repo Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks (experiments + learnings)
- `src/` → (future) structured Python code
- `requirements.txt` → dependencies
- `.gitignore` → ignored files

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aioverloadedVIV/Google-GenAI-Project.git
cd Google-GenAI-Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
