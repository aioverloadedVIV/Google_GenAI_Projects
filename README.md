# Google GenAI API Based Project  

This project is part of my **AI Engineering - working with API Models** where I experiment with Google’s **Gemini API models**.  
It demonstrates how to connect with Gemini via Python SDK, configure environment keys, and generate responses from text and multimodal prompts.

## Current Progress
- Setup Gemini API in Python
- Authenticated using `.env` file 
- Tested Gemini 2.5 Flash for text generation.
- Tested Gemini 2.5 Flash for text generation using Streaming Responses.
- Tested Gemini 2.5 Flash for text generation using Image as an Input (HipHop Image).
- Applied Custom Parameters of Gemini Model to pass on to model.
- Examples are related on my interest which is HipHop Music.
- Project: Conversation Agent
